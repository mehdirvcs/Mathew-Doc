## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

## In God I trust, I do not fear

> 
*My foes turn back when I call on you.
This I know: God is on my side.
I praise the word of God,
I praise the word of the LORD.*
***In God I trust, I do not fear.***
*What can man do to me?*

> **Psalm 56:10-12**

When I fear, I don't trust in God. When I trust in God, I do not fear. If I trust God is on
my side, who or what should I fear? Nothing. Yet I still fear. I fear of outcomes that my will
doesn't desire. I ask for the grace Lord to become aware when I am near being fearful or have become fearful. If I know this, then I can give my fears over to you Lord and realize how vain 
and ridiculous they are. What can man do to me? What can anyone do to me? Nothing. Absolutely 
nothing. Like the psalmist, This I know. God is on my side, I praise the Word of God, I praise the Word of the Lord. I place my trust in you. By your grace I cast all my fears aside.

## The birds of the sky ate it up

>  *When a large crowd gathered, with people from one town after another journeying to him, he spoke in a parable.
“A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path and was trampled, and the birds of the sky ate it up.*

> *This is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God. Those on the path are the ones who have heard, but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts that they may not believe and be saved.*

> **Luke 8:4-5, 8:11-12** 

I was once soil on the path. I went to Catholic school in high school. I had religion classes and had even considered converting. I enjoyed hearing about God, but didn't change my life at all. Then when I went to college and the seed hadn't taken root, the birds of the sky ate it up. I became an atheist, an atheist who would seek to convert others to atheism because of how stupid religion was and I wanted people to know the truth. Thankfully, by His grace people were praying for me. I kept putting myself out there, kept receiving oppurtunities for the someone else to sow the seed within me. My heart was softened through failure and heartbreak and stupidity and desperation.

## Some seed fell on rocky ground

> ***Some seed fell on rocky ground*** *, and when it grew, it withered for lack of moisture.*

> *This is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.*

> *Those on rocky ground are the ones who, when they hear, receive the word with joy, but they have no root; they believe only for a time and fall away in time of trial.*

> **Luke 8:6, Luke 8:11, Luke 8:13**

Finally, my heart became open to the word taking root with my wife. I knew I wanted to marry her. We went to premarriage counseling, I was open to receiving God's Word, and received answers from someone who knew Scripture. I was happy. I was happy going to church every sunday, I was happy going to bible study, and I was happy being part of a community. I'd change my life in some superficial ways, like talking and debating about God online, reading the bible for use in these debates, and even reading the Augsberg Confession. But there was no root. I didn't change my life in significant ways. It was great on sunday, then just like everyone else the rest of the week. There were parts of the gospels I would get uncomfortable with. I would even seek ways to rationalize my sin by downplaying the gospels. 

## Some seed fell among thorns

> ***Some seed fell among thorns*** *, and the thorns grew with it and choked it.*

> *This is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.*

> *As for the seed that fell among thorns, they are the ones who have heard, but as they go along, they are choked by the anxieties and riches and pleasures of life, and they fail to produce mature fruit.*

> **Luke 8:7, Luke 8:11, Luke 8:14**

I feel in some ways my journey as a Lutheran was among thorns as well. I was helping convert people to Christianity, but had sought these pleasures of debating online, respect from others, political outcomes, and vain knowledge. I wasn't producing mature fruit. These thorns grew as my faith in lutheranism grew and choked it. I wasn't truly growing spiritually to God's potential for me. 

## Some seed fell on good soil

> And ***some seed fell on good soil*** *, and when it grew, it produced fruit a hundredfold.” After saying this, he called out, “Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear.”*

> *This is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.*

> *But as for the seed that fell on rich soil, they are the ones who, when they have heard the word, embrace it with a generous and good heart, and bear fruit through perseverance.*

> **Luke 8:8, Luke 8:11, Luke 8:15**

When I had my conversion of heart, the seed was like jack and the beanstalk. Through the prayers of others and God's grace bringing me humility, I was rich soil. My life has totally changed in every aspect. There is no part of my lfie where Jesus is not King of and if I find any part that is, it immediately is under His dominion. No longer do I seek what I'm permitted to do. No longer do I seek political outcomes or vain knowledge or respect from others. I seek to be a donkey. The donkey who obediently follows His Apostles, to be the donkey Christ rides into Jerusalem. I'm sure I'll describe in the future the ways my life has changed in detail. Needless to say, it has produced fruit more than a hundredfold and maybe one day seventy times seven fold. I am totally yours Lord. I will go wherever you want me to go, I will say whatever you want me to say, I will believe whatever you want me to believe. I totally submit to your will. 

Over and over again the Lord shows His providence in this project. Over and over things seem impossible to solve. Whether it's the lack of my experience, the stupidity of myself and others, the lack of financial support, the lack of time, or the quantity of problems to solve, it's made so crystal clear that I cannot do this. But if it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me, all these are solved with ease when I place my trust in Him. And He makes it happen. He'll send me the right person to help me, give me light to know what to do, send me the financial support I need, and increase my endurance and confidence in Him to handle any number of problems. I know this will succeed because God is on my side. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
