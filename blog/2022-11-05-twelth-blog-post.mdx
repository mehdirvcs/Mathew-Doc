## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

## Blessed the man who fears the LORD

> 
***Blessed the man who fears the LORD,***
*who greatly delights in his commands.
His posterity shall be mighty upon the earth;
the upright generation shall be blessed.*

Last week I missed the blog post because I was not working. I volunteered for a youth confirmation retreat. God knows what is best for me. 
Blessed is the man who fears offending the Lord because when you strive not to offend God, you do good by His grace. I have gotten a late start to work today.
I delight in your commands Lord. Forgive me for the short blog post. I love you. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
