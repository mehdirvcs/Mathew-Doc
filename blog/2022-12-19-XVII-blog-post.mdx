## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

## My mouth shall be filled with your praise

> 
***My mouth shall be filled with your praise*** *, and I will sing your glory!Be my rock of refuge,
a stronghold to give me safety,
for you are my rock and my fortress.
O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked. *

> **Psalm 71:3**

A special monday post, saturday I was working on dayjob things and this monday I have all day to work. This is 
because I'm on Christmas vacation. I've felt this strong inspiration for a few years to sing of your glory O Lord.
There's this quote about how singing is praying twice that I love. Most especially though I feel a lot of pressure
to complete this project and I ask you to be my refuge. I feel as though I can't complete this on time just looking
at the calendar and trying to scope out the work remaining. But by your grace I believe all things are possible.

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
