## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

##  Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes

> 
* Then Job answered the Lord:

 “I know that thou canst do all things,
    and that no purpose of thine can be thwarted.
 ‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’
Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,
    things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
 ‘Hear, and I will speak;
    I will question you, and you declare to me.’
 I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear,
    but now my eye sees thee;*
 ***therefore I despise myself,
    and repent in dust and ashes.”***

> **Job 42:1-6**

I despise how I've offended you Lord and am truly sorrowful. I repent in dust and ashes. 
I pray I may never sin or offend you again. I cry out Jesus I trust in you. I know all is forgiven.
I receive absolution from one of your ministers and am forgiven of all my sins. I love you Lord. 

I say with Job that I often utter things I do not understand. Reason about things too wonderful for me.
Speak about things I do not know. I pray that I avoid the near occassions of sin in the future.

## My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness

> 
*And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations, 
a thorn[a] was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to harass me, 
to keep me from being too elated. 
Three times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me; 
 but he said to me, “***My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness***.” 
 I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
  For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, 
  and calamities; for when I am weak, then I am strong.*

 > **2 Corinthians 12:1-10**

I am incredibly weak Lord. I have nothing to boast of. Everything I have is but dust and ashes. Except
for your grace. In my weakness, my hardships, my persecutions, my calamities, and in the insults I 
suffer, that is when I am forged. That is when the chaff of ego, of self righteousness, of hypocrisy,
of disgusting repulsive inclinations to sin are shed and burned. I am scared to ask for these hardships
because I know I cannot bear them on my own. I would crumble by myself if forced to bear what Job had.
But by your grace Lord, I ask that you give me all the hardship, weaknesses, persecutions, calamities,
insults, that you find best to draw me close to your Sacred Heart. You alone are my divine spouse I 
wish to commune with forever. I am nothing good except what you've made me and by grace how you've 
worked through others to make me good. This week, I was able to start developing the first production
screen on android and have the mobile app successfully and securely send/receive to/from the backend.
When I am most weak, truly that is when I am most filled with your grace Lord. 

## I will give you rest

*Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and* ***I will give you rest.***
 *Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, 
 and you will find rest for your souls. 
  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”*

When I search for rest apart from you O God, it is fleeting and vain. Truly there is no comfort the
world could give that would be the same. When I finally give my yoke to you, your yoke is always light
like you promise. You always keep your promises Lord. It's me that gets anxious or nervous or thinks he
knows better when he doesn't. You are at peace and know best Lord. Bring my soul to you. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
