## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

## Bear Fruit Through Perseverance

> 
*But as for the seed that fell on rich soil, 
they are the ones who, 
when they have heard the word, 
embrace it with a generous and good heart, 
and* ***bear fruit through perseverance***.

> **Luke 8:15**

Happy Advent! I love the parable of the sower. I'm here before you once again Lord. Wounded as I am by my sins, I choose to trust in you. Through so many trials and tribulations
that you give me to forge me into the man you want me to become, I persevere to bear fruit I could not imagine. I heard your Words, I embraced you with a generous and good heart,
and now I can begin to see the fruits of this labor. Things are showing up on screen, functionality is starting to come to life, and I can see the app being finished. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
