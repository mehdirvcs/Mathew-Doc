We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week.

## Let Us Come Into His Presence With Thanksgiving

> 
*Come, let us sing joyfully to the LORD;
let us acclaim the Rock of our salvation.*
***Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving;***
*let us joyfully sing psalms to him.*

> **Psalm 95:1-2

Thanksgiving was this thursday and I have so much to be thankful for. My amazing family, my vocations, and the presence of God in my life. I love singing Psalms to you Lord. 
I've made more progress on this project than I ever thought possible. There is an actual map now displaying with a user's location and points of interest. I am making network calls
to a backend server. I'm signing in with user provided credentials. It's a real application I'm building by your grace Lord. Thank you for everything. I've never felt more focused
in my life. I'm ready to do your will. 


## Beware That Your Hearts Do Not Become Drowsy

> 
*Jesus said to his disciples:*
***“Beware that your hearts do not become drowsy
from carousing and drunkenness
and the anxieties of daily life*** *,
and that day catch you by surprise like a trap.
For that day will assault everyone
who lives on the face of the earth.
Be vigilant at all times
and pray that you have the strength
to escape the tribulations that are imminent
and to stand before the Son of Man.”*

> **Luke 21:34-36

I'm very aware how I can become drowsy by the anxieties of daily life. I unite myself to you Lord Jesus. I trust in your mercy. I commit to staying vigilant. I commit
being faithful to you especially when I am weak. Daily life in the world brings so many distractions. But it's how you have called me to serve. I am yours Lord. I'm all in on 
you and I let myself be carried by you to heaven. I love you Lord. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
