## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

## Let Us See Your Face and We Shall Be Saved

> 
*Lord, make us turn to you;* ***let us see your face and we shall be saved***.

> **Psalm 80:2-3**

I give myself to you Lord. This week has been another week of purging of bad desires, crafting me into the man you want me to be. It's another one of those holy 
paradoxes that through desolation, we seek the Lord more fervently. Through desolation we realize our depravity and move towards you. I know everything you permit Lord
is for our good. When you let me see your face I will run to you. I know you are always with me. Guiding me, trying to keep me from stumbling. I don't always listen to 
you and I repent of that. What can I say that has not already been written? But I write to you anyway. I know you will bring everything to fruition according to your will Lord.
You are the king of kings and Lord of Lords. I am yours. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
