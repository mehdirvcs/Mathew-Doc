## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

## When I am Afraid, in You I Place My Trust

> 
*Have mercy on me, God,
for I am treated harshly;
attackers press me all the day.
My foes treat me harshly all the day;
yes, many are my attackers.
O Most High,*
***when I am afraid,
in you I place my trust.***

Last week I missed the blog post because I was sick. I've been very sick these last couple weeks. Today I still have some chest congestion but I'm feeling well enough to work. I 
faced a lot of desolation during these last couple weeks. Been missing daily prayer. I even fell to grave sin. I didn't put much hours into the project and I felt pressed down
by all my attackers. Even feeling bitter and angry. But I was given the grace yesterday to trust in the Lord and I have all these inclinations to be angry and impatient and frustrated.
But I choose you God. I am afraid at time but I choose to place my trust in you. I know I cannot complete this work on my own. I'm at peace with that. Whatever will come, is only
that which you permit. I trust in your providence O Most High. When I am afraid, in you I place my trust. I've got a late start today. Permit me to end this blog post here. I
love you Lord :) 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
