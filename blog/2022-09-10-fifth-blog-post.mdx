## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

## Are we stronger than he?

>  *You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. 
You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 
Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy?* ***Are we stronger than he?***

> **1 Corinthians 10:14-22**

I am not stronger than you Lord. There is no one stronger than you. It is foolishness to trust in anyone or anything else. 
This passage, St. Paul is talking about not drinking the cup of those
offered for pagan idols. But he also is talking about communion. Who am I communing with? What am I communing with? When I sit down to relax, 
am I communing with that which is vain or disturbs my peace? Or am I communing with God? Am I communing with my family in a loving way? Am I 
seeking only the communion of the Lord, not just at the mass, but everywhere? I choose to commune only with God.

## Men are all a vain hope


> *For thou hast delivered my soul from death,
    my eyes from tears,
    my feet from stumbling;
 I walk before the Lord
    in the land of the living.
 I kept my faith, even when I said,
    “I am greatly afflicted”;
 I said in my consternation,*
    ***“Men are all a vain hope.”***

> **Psalm 116:8-11** 

Men are all a vain hope O Lord. Help everyone understand this. We cannot hope in what men will do for us for we are all weak. We cannot hope in 
men understanding us, for no one understands. But we have great hope Lord. Your grace is everything and you are more generous than we can imagine.
Your mercy is overflowing and you are so gracious that even the way you communicate grace is gracious by choosing us to participate in spreading your mercy.
You have delivered my soul from certain death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling. You have converted me, you have
prevented me from regretting decisions not to follow you, and you keep me from stumbling into sin. I beg for your grace Lord. If it were not
for the knowledge of your mercy, I would cry out like St. Peter "Depart from me for I am a sinful man". 

## Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do what I tell you?

> ***“Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do what I tell you?*** *Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them, 
I will show you what he is like: he is like a man building a house, who dug deep, and laid the foundation upon rock; 
and when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it had been well built. 
But he who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; against which the stream broke, 
and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.”*

> **Luke 6:46-49**

I come to you, I hear you Lord, and I do what you say. Not all the time. May God forbid me and keep me from any sin. But I have chosen my foundation.
Any other foundation is vain. Vanity of vanities. May God forbid anyone from sin, from choosing any other foundation. It is certain ruin. Hold me close to 
you Lord and keep from all evil. This solid foundation is not only for my faith and life but also this software. I have taken time to do the research
alongside you Lord and build something scalable that won't be shaken. 

## In humility count others better than yourselves

> *Do nothing from selfishness or conceit, but* ***in humility count others better than yourselves.*** 

> **Philippians 2:3**

I don't even post the whole passage from Phillipians 2 here. The full passage is about imitating Christ's humility Philippians 2:1-11. There is just
so much there I would be writing for hours and never start work. So I choose verse 3 here. When we value ourselves and our ability, we don't ask questions.
We trust in our understanding. We don't seek God. But when you recognize truly others are better than you, it is key. Humility is the key. You recognize the 
great dignity of others. You ask questions and are open to answers. You will seek God. It's everything. Humility is everything. I come back to the words
of Lila Rose: "Let your heart break". If you let your heart break, you are open to the miserable state you are in, that the world is in, you are open to 
the grace of God and Our Lord and savior Jesus Christ. Glory To God In The Highest! And On Earth, Peace To Men Of Good Will! My heart breaks for you Lord.
It's becoming raw and sensitive to breaking more frequently as I unite myself ever closer to your Sacred Heart. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
