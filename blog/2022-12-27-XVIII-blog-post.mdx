*Beloved:
What was from the beginning,
what we have heard,
what we have seen with our eyes,
what we looked upon
and* ***touched with our hands***
*concerns the Word of life —
for the life was made visible;
we have seen it and testify to it
and proclaim to you the eternal life
that was with the Father and was made visible to us— 
what we have seen and heard
we proclaim now to you,
so that you too may have fellowship with us;
for our fellowship is with the Father
and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
We are writing this so that our joy may be complete.*

> **1 John 1:1-4**

A special tuesday post, Saturday was Christmas and yesterday I failed to make a post due to failed considerations. But today is a wonderful day as it is the Feast Day of St. John the Apostle
and Evangelist. This letter in particular speaks so clearly to why I'm here. The apostles heard, we saw, we touched, and testified. They were given these wonderful consolations so that
they may spread the good news to the world and by the drawing the world into fellowship with His Church, their joy may be complete. That's why I've been given the consolations I have. 
The Apostles joy and my joy is complete through fellowship. God bless them for all they did to spread the faith and give us what we have today. Especially St. John who wrote magnificently
and trained great men like St. Polycarp and St. Ignatius of Antioch. St. John, pray for us. Thank you Lord for sending me a helper as well. Help me to be faithful to you and the work
you have prepared for me to do. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
