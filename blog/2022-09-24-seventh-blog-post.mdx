## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

## Prosper the work of our hands for us!

> 
*Fill us at daybreak with your kindness,
that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days.
And may the gracious care of the LORD our God be ours;*
***Prosper the work of our hands for us!***
*Prosper the work of our hands!*

> **Psalm 90:14, 17**

Without God, nothing good will prosper. If I want things to be excellent, I need God to prosper the work of our hands for me.
I'm very thankful I got to sing this psalm in mass on Thursday. I love singing the psalms just like the ancient israelites. 
You are so gracious Lord. In every age O Lord, you have been our refuge. 

## Vanity of vanities! All is vanity

> 
*Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher,*
    ***vanity of vanities! All is vanity.***

> **Ecclesiastes 1:2**

Everything really is vanity. All the goods of this world don't exceed even the smell of a single flower in heaven. When we 
are fully united with God, we will see how utterly vain the consolations of this world are. Forgive us of our vanity Lord. 
Forgive me of my vanity. Never permit me to forget the vanity of seeking anything but you Lord. My divine spouse, I gravely
offend you. Through my fault, through my fault, through my most grevious fault. I ask for you to pray for me everyone reading this
to the Lord Our God. That I may never choose to trust in anything but Jesus. Everything else is vanity. Vacations, big houses,
nice cars, sex, money, respect, honors, technology, it is all vanity. It is all like the changing grass. Vanity of Vanities! 
All is vanity. 

## My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness

> 
*I must boast; there is nothing to be gained by it, but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of 
the body I do not know, God knows. 
And I know that this man was caught up into Paradise—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows— 
 and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. 
 On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses. 
 Though if I wish to boast, I shall not be a fool, for I shall be speaking the truth. 
 But I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me. 
 And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, 
 a messenger of Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. 
 Three times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me; 
 but he said to me,* ***“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”***
*I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
 For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities; 
 for when I am weak, then I am strong.*

 > **2 Corinthians 12:1-10**

 The Apostle St. Paul with another wonderful spiritual lesson, given to him by Our Lord. God's power is made perfect,
 in weakness. Truly it's the most weak, the most wandered sheep, where it is all the more clear that it is not them at work,
 But God at work. God's providence is most visible, when He acts through the least of us. I am the last person who should be 
 make this app. No prior experience in Swift, Kotlin, or RIBs, yet all 3 are key to the success of this application. There is 
 absolutely no way possible with men to do this. But with God, all things are possible. Everyday, every single day, He is working
 to help me. Therefore like Paul, I am content with weakness, insults, hardships, persecutions, even calamities. For when I am
 weak, then I am strong. When it seems more unlikely in human terms than ever I can succeed, that is when God's power is perfected
 and He will succeed through me. Glory to God in the highest! And on earth, peace to all people of good will! This week I will
 finish setup for iOS and Android so I can begin production properly. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
