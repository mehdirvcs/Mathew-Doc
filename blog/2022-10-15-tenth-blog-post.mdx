## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

## Abide in my Love

> 
*If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you. 
 By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples. 
 As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you;* ***abide in my love.*** *
 If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Fatherâ€™s commandments and abide in his love.
 These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full."*

> **John 15:7-11**

How many times must you prove yourself to me Lord before I believe you? I still sin. I still don't always keep your commandments. Truly keeping your commandments is abiding
in your love for you give them to us out of love. When I sin, I don't trust you. I think I know better. When I abide in your love, I trust you. You love us so much Lord.
I'm so weak. But I choose to abide in you Lord by your grace. 

## The Law of The Lord is Perfect, Refreshing the Soul

> ***The law of the LORD is perfect,
  refreshing the soul.***
*The decree of the LORD is trustworthy,
  giving wisdom to the simple.
the precepts of the Lord are right,
    rejoicing the heart;
the commandment of the Lord is pure,
    enlightening the eyes;
the fear of the Lord is clean,
    enduring for ever;
the ordinances of the Lord are true,
    and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold,
    even much fine gold;
sweeter also than honey
    and drippings of the honeycomb.*
*

> **Psalm 19:7-10**

I can't imagine not living for you Lord. This week was full of grace and desolation. On one hand, you gave me the task to intercede for two people close to me through unceasing 
prayer and even invite others to do so. It was incredible, we prayed so much for them. I grew so much in my understanding of mercy and was Inspired by many ideas of mercy. 
On the other hand, physical suffering, distraction, and changes in my routine made it difficult to focus and be faithful to my vocations. But in both of these you draw me closer
to you Lord. They feed one another. These great consolations and cooperation with your grace are wonderful. Participating in the salvation of others while being edified myself.
On the other hand, these trials are opportunities to trust in you and be faithful even when it's not convenient. It's purifying and purgative. You are so gracious Lord. We can 
trust you. God forbid I ever stray from you Lord and choose a lesser life of vanity and meaninglessness and trinkets. God forbid me from sinning against you even one more time.
For there is nothing in this world that can compare to you. I love you with all of myself. I would take a whole life, a thousands lifetimes of desolation before sinning against
you. I believe you Lord. I trust you. I've hurt you over and over again through my sins and I'm sorry. I wish to hurt you no more. Sweeter than honey are your ordinances. If
only everyone could see Lord. 

## In Thee O Lord Do I Take Refuge

> ***In thee, O Lord, do I take refuge;***
    *let me never be put to shame!
 In thy righteousness deliver me and rescue me;
    incline thy ear to me, and save me!
 Be thou to me a rock of refuge,
    a strong fortress, to save me,
    for thou art my rock and my fortress.*

> **Psalm 71:1-3**

This week was another week of fixing backend bugs which weren't scoped for. It's okay though. God takes care of His children. I am His adopted beloved son. He will not let me
be put to shame. I abide in you Lord and your words abide in me. I ask whatever I will, and it is done for me. 
There is not a single problem that hasn't been solved on this project by simply asking God for the answer. He is trustworthy, He makes it happen. He gives me rest. He gives a 
superabundance of grace to me. I know all these problems will be solved just like that last ones were. It really is just a matter of showing up and persevering through desolation
and trusting in you Lord. I don't need to be brilliant or clever or a great software engineer. I can just be myself, trust in you, and you will provide not only what is lacking 
but an overabundance of grace to make it excellent. In you, I take refuge. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
