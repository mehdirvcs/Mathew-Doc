## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

## Seek to Serve Him Constantly

> 
*"Look to the LORD in his strength;*
***seek to serve him constantly***.
*Recall the wondrous deeds that he has wrought,
his portents, and the judgments he has uttered.*"

> **Psalm 105:4-5**

With all my mind, all my body, all my heart, and all my soul I seek to serve you Lord. I reject serving the World, I seek 
to serve you Lord. Over and over you do these wonderful things, raise up great saints, and are justice and mercy. Throw all the vanity
away. Take everything that is vain away from me Lord. I want to serve you simply and purely. To participate in making clear to 
everyone your grace, mercy, and glory. You are so close Lord. If only everyone could see living for you brings freedom and meaning. 
If only people could experience zeal and love and that loving discipline you give to your beloved Children. You always know best Lord. 

## For the Lord Reproves Him Whom He Loves

> *My son, do not despise the Lord’s discipline
    or be weary of his reproof,*
  ***for the Lord reproves him whom he loves*** *,
    as a father the son in whom he delights.*

> **Proverbs 3:11-12**

"What do you want me to learn from this Lord?" That is how I respond and need to remember to respond to things that don't appear to go my
way. God can do anything, He gives the best gifts. The reason He reproves me is because He wants me to learn something. He delights in me.
He wants to pour out all His treasures for me. I need to accept the Lord's discipline with joy and knowledge that a Father only reproves
a child who He knows is capable of change and growth. My vocation as a father involves that. My vocation as a software engineer is reproving
my program. The wonderful ways you give us to imitate you Lord. If only everyone could see this beauty.

## Blessed are Those Who Hear the Word of God and Observe It

> *While Jesus was speaking,
a woman from the crowd called out and said to him,
“Blessed is the womb that carried you
and the breasts at which you nursed.”
He replied, “Rather,* ***blessed are those
who hear the word of God and observe it*** *.”*

> **Luke 11:27-28**

Inspired to by God to bless His mother, a woman from the crowd shouts out from the crowd. Jesus replies that it is not simply a blessing
to be His mother (although it is a blessing as well). His mother's heart was prophesied by Simeon to be greatly pierced and was during
her Son's passion. But the greatest blessing His mother received was that she heard the Word of God and observed it perfectly. There is
nothing more perfect than God's Will and being blessed by God's grace to be kept from stumbling and cooperating with that grace, is truly
the greatest blessing. And if she was His mother and did not hear and observe His Word, being His mother would be a far greater shame than
a blessing. That someone so close to Her son would so gravely offend Him, that would rather be a great shame than a blessing. 
But combined both being His mother, hearing the word of God, and observing it, no one is more Blessed than the one whom all 
generations shall call Blessed. Thank you mom, I love you :). 
Thank you Lord for opening up this scripture to me. Bless all the ways I serve you. Jesus I trust in you. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
