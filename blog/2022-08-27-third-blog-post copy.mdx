## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. 

## I Desire Mercy not Sacrifice

> *But go and learn what this means: * ***‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’*** *For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.*

> **Matthew 9:13**

God has shown me incredible mercy. There's been such great strides and setbacks this week in development. 
From finally clicking with the architecture and feeling confident in how I'm going to code this, to understanding unit testing
and TDD, all the way to delaying the start of development and having to learn this backend system and make it secure.
Whether good times or bad, I will always acknowledge I can do ***nothing*** good of myself. It is all by His grace and mercy that anything
will succeed. Our Father is so generous, I know He will make happen the best things. Even things we think to be impossible. 

## Praise the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

> *** Praise the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.***

> **Psalm 136:1** 

Your mercy endures forever O God. I run to your mercy, your infinite universe of mercy. The universe, the one word, you speak is mercy.
I am yours and you are mine. You will always take care of me and show mercy to me. I don't rely on my own cleverness. I rely on your mercy.
I rely on your grace. That is the only way. I'm out in deep water. Like Peter walking out on the water to run to you, I can't do this project
of my own nature and skills even if I had a hundred years of development experience. There is no where else for me to go. 
The only way to stop from drowning is to walk to you Lord. That is what I will do. 

## He delighteth in mercy

> *Who is a God like to thee, who takest away iniquity, and passest by the sin of the remnant of thy inheritance? 
He will send his fury in no more, because* ***he delighteth in mercy***.*
He will turn again, and have mercy on us: he will put away our iniquities: and he will cast all our sins into the bottom of the sea.
Thou wilt perform the truth of Jacob, the mercy to Abraham: which thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of old.*

> **Micah 7:18-20**

This was the second week of technical design, it was planned to be the final week. But this plan was with the assumption the existing
backend system would be secured and it is not. There also seems to be major features missing from the backend system which are going to result
in features getting cut. So with these features being cut, extending Pre-Production and Core phase by two more weeks, it gives some more time
to really do this Core loop properly, secure the app, and get things going on the right path. There is a temptation to despair. Despair
can seem consoling and cathartic. But it is not. It hurts you, it's an offense against God's mercy, and trust that He will make things good.
God delights in mercy and I will be faithful to His mercy. I will sing of it all the day long. 

## Present your bodies as a living sacrifice

> *I appeal to you therefore, brethren,* ***by the mercies of God*** *, 
to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. 
Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, 
that you may prove what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect*

> **Romans 12:1-2**

I give my whole being to you Lord. My body is a living sacrifice to you. My mind has been renewed and is being renewed daily to walk 
in your mercy and grace. I wish to be an apostle of your mercy. I give all of it, everything, up to you God. That is why I know these
endeavors will succeed. You know my heart as I write these words. It breaks for you and your passion. I'm tired Lord, I took a sick day
this Monday from exhaustion. I totally rely on your mercy to carry me and I keep going. No matter what happens, I grow in union with you Lord.
Your grace is enough. Your mercy is enough. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
