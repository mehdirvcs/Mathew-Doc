# Genesis

What are we doing here?

## In the Beginning

There's this app called Boat-It and we want to make an iOS version of it. So let's begin.

## Create the Heavens and the Earth

To build this creation, we'll be using the following tools:
* IDE
  * [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro) specifically Android Studio Bumblebee (2021.1.1) Patch 3
    * Installer for Mac Apple Silicon [here](https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/install/2021.1.1.23/android-studio-2021.1.1.23-mac_arm.dmg)
    * Installer for Mac Intel [here](https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/install/2021.1.1.23/android-studio-2021.1.1.23-mac.dmg)
* Text editor
  * [VSCode](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
* Documentation
  * [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs)
* Gitlab for our Git hosting services. [*Find the repo here*](https://gitlab.com/solace-studios/boat-it_ios)
* [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) for git functionality. For visualization, you may use VSCode or Android Studio.
* For dependency management, we'll be using [gradle](https://gradle.org)
* Package management
  * [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
  * [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io)

## The Earth was without form and void

The architecture of our app will be using [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/RIBs). What we'll do first is create a more general decision tree 
and from there break down that tree into a RIB tree, seperating concerns into different RIBs where it makes sense. We'll also be documenting the different streams
of data that the RIBs will be working with. So we can see what RIBs need what components from their parents. 

## Darkness was upon the face of the deep

The dependencies we'll be using include 
* Navionics SDK
* Google Maps SDK
* For Networking: RxJava
* Braintree
* MySQL for Database
* PHP for webadmin 
* Dependency injection RxJava
* [Ramotion UI Kit Components](https://github.com/Ramotion/android-ui-animation-components-and-libraries)
