## Hi there

This is the very first blog post of Solace Studios. Welcome. I'm so happy for you to join us on this journey. 

## Neither to the right nor to the left 

One of my favorite bible passages that is considered rather obscure is 1 Samuel 6:12. 

> *And the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-she′mesh along one highway, lowing as they went; 
> **they turned neither to the right nor to the left**, 
> and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-she′mesh.*
>
> 1 Samuel 6:12

The Philistines captured the ark of the covenant, Israel's most holy possession. But great harms were happening to the Philistines. 
So to figure out if the cause of their issues was the ark, they placed it on a cart along with figures of gold for a guilt offering. 
They then yoked two cows to the cart and sent them on their way with no instructions. The cows immediately headed toward Beth-she`mesh a city of Israel. 

 This is what I hope to do. I pray that I might follow the Lord exactly as He wants me to. 
 Turning neither to the left nor to the right, following God's instructions and inspirations exactly as He intends for me. 

 ## Peace! Be Still!

 > *And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, **“Peace! Be still!”** And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.*
 >
 > Mark 4:35-41

I know I can't succeed on this journey on my own. I'm personally a mediocre and miserable programmer.
If success is to come at all, it will only be by the grace of God and all glory will be to Him. 
So I consecrate this entire project to the Lord and to the intercession of St. Joseph the Worker who I hope to emulate the faithfulness of work ethic of.
I give my all my effort to this project, but there isn't enough time to complete it. I simply don't have the hours to do everything that needs to be done. 
Taking care of my wife and 2 kids, visiting my family who is sick and in need, with no knowledge of swift/iOS/Kotlin and not enough knowledge of Java/Android, I can't do it.
But if I give everything up to God, if I entrust God to be my codeveloper, and lay it all out on the field, I know the absolute best will happen. 

And I can't wait to see what that is. 

## While he slept took one of his RIBs 

> *So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while **he slept took one of his ribs** and closed up its place with flesh; 
> and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. Then the man said,*
>
> *“This at last is bone of my bones*
>
> *and flesh of my flesh;*
>
> *she shall be called Woman,*
>
>    *because she was taken out of Man.”*
>
> *Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh.*
>
> Genesis 2:21-24

We'll be making our upcoming project using [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/RIBs) architecture. 
A novel approach to app design created by Uber that allows business logic of other architectures to stay the same while UI specific elements can be 
platform specific.

## But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord

> *“Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve the Lord. 15 And if you be unwilling to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell; **but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord**.”*

> Joshua 24:14-15

I want again thank you for starting this journey with me. I promise I will make these blog posts weekly. I will be faithful to this promise. 
These last 4 weeks have been about describing the UX of the app, Research, and development setup. 
Doing things like going through [iOS](https://github.com/uber/RIBs/tree/main/ios/tutorials) and [Android](https://github.com/uber/RIBs/tree/main/android/tutorials) tutorials,
 Setting up samples/tools to build, run, and examine on iOS like [this RIBs/buck/needle implentation that has an example of a plugin](https://github.com/Angel-Cortez/example-buck-ribs-needle) and [that small needle RIBs sample](https://github.com/feb19/needle-ribs-sample-ios) as well as [this RIBs using SwiftUI tool](https://github.com/dehrom/RIBs-SwiftUI)
 and on Android [here with a RIBs ScreenStack implentation to show examples of how to transition between screens well](https://github.com/bangarharshit/Ribs-ScreenStack-Impl).

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
