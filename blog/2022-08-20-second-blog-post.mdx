## Intro

Hello again! Just like I said last week, I'm making another blog post this saturday morning. 
I've tried doing dev blog posts before, it hasn't worked. I would get distracted or forget to do them.
But this time I'm gonna stick with it by the grace of God. 

## You Have the Words of Eternal Life

> *Jesus said to the twelve, “Will you also go away?” 
 Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go?* ***You have the words of eternal life*** *; 
  and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.”* 

> **John 6:67-69**

Jesus gives this long discourse on the eucharist to the jews. He explains that this unleavend bread truly
is His body and this wine truly is His blood. Many jews and his own disciples leave Him because of this.
Jesus asks His Apostles if they will leave too. But St. Peter speaking for them all says "Lord to whom shall we go?
You have the words of eternal life". He's given it all up to the Lord. For better or worse, at least in an earthly sense,
he has chosen Jesus. 

I have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God. When things get tough, I don't shrink or run from you. 
I lean in deeper. I swim faster and faster, deeper
and deeper down the depths of your ocean of mercy. I praise you for the humility you've brought me. I am yours and you are mine.
I choose you Jesus.

## We are the People of His Pasture

This one comes from [Lauds](https://universalis.com/0/i-lauds.htm) today 

> *O come, let us worship and bow down,
    let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker!
  For he is our God,
    and* ***we are the people of his pasture*** *,
    and the sheep of his hand.*

> **Psalm 95:6-7**

It's okay. It's okay to not know. To not know what to do next all the time. There are times when I don't know
what to do. But precisely in the measure I trust in God's goodness to reveal to me what I should do, 
is the measure that it becomes more clear. Jesus is the light of the world, in Him we move and have our being.
He will certainly give us light on what to do when we ask in simplicity and humility. 

## Humility Goes Before Honor

> *Before destruction a man’s heart is haughty,
    but* ***humility goes before honor*** *.*

> **Proverbs 18:12**

This was the first week of Technical Design. 
First on the agenda was to list out dependencies for iOS and Android so we can properly organize the RIB tree.
To that end, we first had to confirm RIBs is the architecture we were going with. I had concerns about handling screen transitions,
process death (recovering from the Android OS killing the app in the background), and the activity of the repo in getting questions answered.

I explored a few different options. Kotlin MultiPlatform (KMP) was something I was very interested in. I decided not to go with it. 
KMP has a lot of potential, but has been in alpha the last 5 years. When an API is in alpha, it means they 
may introduce "breaking changes". This is where upgrading to a newer version of KMP would provide greater features,
but these greater features would require a lot of investment to integrate and your project in its current state would be broken.
It's also very complicated to know what belongs in the native code sections and what belongs in the shared section.
I haven't seen many large scale apps using RIBs or a similar scalable architecture with KMP
Without clear guidelines on how to do that, it would be better to abstain from that. 
I also was concerned about the ability to bring on new engineers. The foundational principle that drives all my architecture
decisions is scalability. If God graces this endeavor enough to be able to bring other people on to work on it, they need to be
able get up to speed and be able to contribute in a meaningful way as soon as possible. As KMP is in alpha, there isn't a lot
of engineers who use it, very very few at scale and obviously no one uses it at scale in it's beta or release form as those 
don't exist yet.

I also looked into flutter. With flutter, I'd be able to write a lot of code once and minimize the amount of native code in the project.
It also has a JIT compiler which makes development very fast. You can see changes immediatelyIt looks very cool. 
But there's only one hobby project using RIBs and flutter
and I don't see any companies using it at scale with a similar architecture. It would also increase the amount of languages I'd need to know.
With KMP, I could write shared code in Kotlin, android code in Kotlin, and iOS code in Swift. But with flutter, I'd have to write
all the shared code in Dart (which I have no experience with). Cool idea, not for this project though.

There was also [DeCompose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose). One of the things I was really interested in was upgrading on Android from developing UI in xml to Jetpack Compose
and on iOS from UIKit to SwiftUI. DeCompose has a similar architecture to RIBs, more extendable, and uses both SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose.
I was also worried about how RIBs would handle Process Death since I talked to some people and said you cannot save state if you 
are using RIBs. But I found out I can save the necessary states in User Preferences. DeCompose also has no substantial examples using both Android and iOS that I have found.
There's also the lack of tooling.
So while I'd like to migrate to SwiftUI and Compose in the future, it would be too much of a risk to start with it now.

So we're going with RIBs! Swift for iOS, for the moment Kotlin for android. 
I have a list of Kotlin RIBs examples I'm going to go through to confirm that. 
I also upgraded RIBs/Buck/Needle on Swift to 0.13.0. I hope to do the same with android.
 I also finalized other dependencies for things like mapping, payment api, dependency injection, and UI toolkit.

The final dependencies to worry about is communicating with the web server. I documented all the webservice calls for the current app.
What they do, what they send, what they receive, and what they do in response. 

Looking through the code of someone else, it can be a near occassion of sin. Thoughts of how you would do something different
come to mind. But give someone the mercy and grace that you would like to receive in return. If we are humble, 
honor will follow. 

## Draw Near to the Throne of Grace

> *“Let us then with confidence* ***draw near to the throne of grace*** *, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."*

> **Hebrews 4:16**

I'm ready to draw near to the throne of grace. Thank you God for pouring out your mercy on me. Jesus I trust in you.

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
