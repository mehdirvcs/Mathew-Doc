## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Jesus I trust in you.

## He Who Conceals His Transgressions Will Not Prosper

> 
***He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper*** *,
but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.*

> **Proverbs 28:13**

I love you Lord. I forsake my transgressions and will confess them to you later today. You are so gracious and merciful and there has been so much progress this week.
I've struggled through this backend programming. It's something I'm not familiar with in any way whatsoever. But you carried me through Lord. It is finished as far as
I can tell. I would have never had this experience without you preparing every step of the way with your grace. I can't thank you enough God. I'm sorry for my sins
because I hate to offend you and I seek your mercy which is so glorious.

## He Who Trusts in The Lord is Safe

> *The fear of man lays a snare,
but he who trusts in the Lord is safe.*

> **Proverbs 29:25**

I'm aware of how limited time we have for this project. But how can I fear man? How can I fear financial consequences? How can I fear consequences for my reputation?
All is vanity except you Lord. I trust you will only permit that which draws me closer to you. I've only gotten this far because of you God. I will not take any step
that you have not asked me to walk in.

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
