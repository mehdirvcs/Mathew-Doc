## Intro

We meet once again! Thank you for joining me here this week. 
Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. 

## Believe that you have received it

> *Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer,* ***believe that you have received it*** *, and it will be yours.*

> **Mark 11:24**

This project is impossible of myself. I have to code a backend using php, something I have absolutely no experience in, using a bunch of frameworks I 
also have no experience in, with no time to learn. 
I would have no reason to perserve frankly. But with encouragement from the greatest gift from God, my divinely gifted wife, through God's grace,
I take one step at a time forward with Him. Each step I take, no matter how small, I know is guided by Him. This is His Will and therefore the best possible
thing I could do. I don't deserve the gifts He has given me and continues to give me. He is just so gracious. The fact He wants to include me in a role in
the theodrama, it's astonishing and beggars belief truly. I ask for something, beg in all humility, and I know my divine spouse will give 
me exactly what I need. 

## The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein;

> ***The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof,*** *
    the world and those who dwell therein;
for he has founded it upon the seas,
    and established it upon the rivers.
Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord?
    And who shall stand in his holy place?
He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
    who does not lift up his soul to what is false,
    and does not swear deceitfully.
He will receive blessing from the Lord,
    and vindication from the God of his salvation.
Such is the generation of those who seek him,
    who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah
Lift up your heads, O gates!
    and be lifted up, O ancient doors!
    that the King of glory may come in.
Who is the King of glory?
    The Lord, strong and mighty,
    the Lord, mighty in battle!
Lift up your heads, O gates!
    and be lifted up, O ancient doors!
    that the King of glory may come in.
Who is this King of glory?
    The Lord of hosts,
    he is the King of glory!Selah*

> **Psalm 24:1-10** 

I was honored to sing this psalm in mass on thursday. I will always include a psalm every week. They are an inexhuastible source of edification and truth.
All of scripture is of course, but the Psalms have a special place because they are meant to be sung. When we sing to God, we pray twice. We are praying
the words we sing with all meaning and truth, but we are also praying that our voice might be satisfying to the Lord and bring glory to Him. As Psalm 24 says,
everything already belongs to God. What can we possibly give Him? How can we even approach Him? We do so by avoiding evil in action (clean hands)
and seeking reconciliation immediately if, may God forbid, we commit a single sin (pure heart). We do so by not lifting up our soul to what is false, not indulging
in trash content and media. We do so by not swearing deceitfully, by keeping all our resolutions with the Lord and following His inspirations. If we do this,
we will receive incredible blessings from the Lord who is the giver of the best gifts. Oh my Lord, you are so sweet and there is none like you.

## He arose from his throne, removed his robe, and covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes

> *Then tidings reached the king of Nin′eveh, and* ***he arose from his throne, removed his robe, and covered himself with sackcloth, 
and sat in ashes.*** *And he made proclamation and published through Nin′eveh, 
“By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; 
let them not feed, or drink water, but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them cry mightily to God; 
yea, let every one turn from his evil way and from the violence which is in his hands. 
Who knows, God may yet repent and turn from his fierce anger, so that we perish not?”
When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God repented of the evil which he had said he would do to them; and he did not do it.*

> **Jonah 3:6-10**

Oh my Lord, when I think of the ungratefulness I have and the world has, I want to cover myself with sackcloth and ashes. Oh my Lord my heart breaks.
I sit here in my comfortable chair, in an air conditioned house, with your Church right around the corner from my house. Yet I still sin. I still offend you
Lord. How can I humble myself before you except by doing as the King of Nin′eveh did, fasting, ashes, and sackcloth? When you see my heart before you 
in such a state, you take pity on me Lord. You console me and draw me close to you. I will never fathom the depths of your mercy and love. A love like this
will never be conceived of in our minds. So I pour my soul before you Lord so that you may uplift it to be able to commune with you. Protect me from all evil
and bring me to everlasting life. 

We do not live in a state of Justice before you Lord. We live in a state far better, that of Mercy. Who dares say he believe in God? If we were to live in a
state of justice and try to say that and act as we do, we would be liars. But we don't live in a state of justice. We live in a state of mercy. God permits
us to be fools so we can seek His mercy. Through His mercy and the seeking of His mercy, we are transfigured. We become humble, we become spotless, we become
worthy of Him because He is making us to be Him through the works He has prepared for us to walk in! We are decreasing, but not being annihilated, 
but instead transfigured! Oh my Lord, you lift my soul up to close union with you. I will sing of your mercy forever and be an Apostle of your Mercy. The 
most grave offenses against you are those that don't acknowledge your mercy. Glory to God in the highest and on the earth peace to all people of good will!
My Lord my God, I am yours and nothing will keep me from you. You uplift my soul to be able to commune with you even as I write this. 

## “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”

> *As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, 
casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. And he said to them, ***“Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”***
*Immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on from there he saw two other brothers, 
James the son of Zeb′edee and John his brother, in the boat with Zeb′edee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. 
Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.*

> **Matthew 4:18-22**

Your words are so sweet my Lord. You will make me a fisher of men Lord. Through my work, you will sanctify me. 
I leave everything vain to follow you and your will Lord. This week, I will be securing the backend, finalizing technical design, 
and doing final preparation to begin production on the iOS version of the app. 

 That's all for now, thank you :) I love you God
